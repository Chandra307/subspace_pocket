# subspace_pocket
Created a Dockerfile and built an image out of it and ran hasura-cli in a docker container.
Setup a postgres server to run on the local machine.
Pulled an image and ran hasura/graphql-engine in another container.
Connected  the psotgres server running locally to the hasura/gql-engine.
All other activity will be reflected by the code I pushed to git.
