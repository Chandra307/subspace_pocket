# Here's the setup part
With the help of a well configured docker-compose.yml file, I had created separate containers for Postgres server and Hasura/Graphql-engine and had them running in an Amazon EC2 instance.
Using the migration file I already had on my local machine, I created tables and designed schema on the remote Postgres database server.
Cloned the repository after making a few changes regarding host address etc.
Pulled the changes from the remote repo and started my node.js server.
All other activity will be reflected by the code I pushed to git.
